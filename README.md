# :wave: Hi there!
üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªI'm Mariya Diminsky, a passionate self-taught Software Engineer. For over 5 years I've worked as a Full Stack Engineer, a Frontend Developer(I :sparkling_heart: React), and a Unity/C# developer.

During my free time I love to :running_woman: hike, :airplane: travel, and :video_game: play games with my husband and toddler. I also enjoy working on several side projects including my indie game studio‚Äî[TrinityMoon Studios](https://www.trinitymoonstudios.com/). Try out the DEMO of my first game, [The Girl Who Knew Time](https://github.com/maariyadiminsky/thegirlwhoknewtime-preview). It's a lot of fun!

üëÄ I'm currently taking deep dives on different system designs, algorithms, as well as other technologies I want to learn. Other than spending time with my family, most of my time is consumed by researching and learning about new and existing web, game, blockchain and machine learning tech. Both my husband and I are immensely interested about these subjects and enjoy discussing them.

‚úçÔ∏èTeaching and making complicated subjects easier to understand brings me a lot of joy. That's why whenever I can, I write for publications like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/blog/) and [JavaScript in Plain English](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/). Check out some of my articles [here](https://github.com/maariyadiminsky/technical-writer).
